NOTE : 
ðŸ“„ Template Source and Copyright
    The template used for this portfolio is sourced from a publicly available design, and it is referenced directly in the head tag of the index.html file. I do not claim ownership or copyright over the original template.

    If you would like to view the template source, it is linked within the index.html file under the <head> section, where the necessary styles and scripts are included.

    I do not intend to infringe on any copyright and acknowledge the work of the original creators. This portfolio serves purely as a demonstration of my personal skills and experience.

    I just customize some codes of my own like adding some scripts and css.

    Thank you.
